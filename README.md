I made my project on a K-Pop group called NCT. NCT is one of the unique groups because they have this
theme of "infinity." Currently, there are total of 23 members, and more get added every year.
There are currently four sub groups (NCT U, NCT 127, NCT Dream, and WayV), and more can be created
as necessary. Because of this, they have NCT 2018, 2020, and 2021, where they released an album with
every NCT member within that year. Every member has position of either dance, vocal, or rap.

So, with my application, you are able to sort by age and alphabetical of all the members and filter by
sub-groups and position. Among the 23 members, it's hard to have one "bias" (a term used to say your
favorite member), so I made a "bias list," where you can add your favorite members to your list, and
it gives an average of their age.

I only had NCTMember Component, which handles adding and removing members from the bias list and
displaying the members using "Card" from react bootstrap. To implement this, the props I had to
use were: name, image, position, group, age, and two useState variables that help re-render the
total number (to calculate the average) and biaslist.

I tried to make the website responsive by putting the filter on the top of the page so that
the users recognize that it is a functionality that they can use with this website when the
screen shrinks.

P.S. The background color is their fandom color :")
